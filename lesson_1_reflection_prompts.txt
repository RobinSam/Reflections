How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me quickly realize what was causing the bug and helped me in fixing the issue.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to the history will save me from having to delete huge chunks of a file and try to think what I typed previously. 
    I will instead just have to access the previous version to get back all my work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros of manually commiting are that you can choose when to make a commit based on a logical change. 
    The con of manually committing is that you tend to commit at different intervals of time and you could forget to commit if it is taking too long to fix a bug.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows you to save multiple files in a single commit allowing there to be unity between files of the same repository. This way
    your work is cohesive and there is minimal confusion as to what changes were made in each commit. However, in Docs, you need to open each file
    separately and figure out what changes were made.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use git log to find out how many commits have been made and I can use git diff to figure out the changes made in each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can become more confident since even if I break something, I can checkout previous version that aren't broken and start over.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I might use Git to help me organize different version of programs that I have created.
