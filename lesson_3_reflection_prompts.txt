When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository when I'm working in a team where everyone needs each other's work and not just 
their own. Using a local repository in that situation would only hurt the team and prevent it from getting work done.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This way, you will know for yourself what files are in each pull. Also, if Git automatically pulled, then you wouldn't
understand some of the files if you hadn't looked at other pull requests earlier.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is cloning repositories on GitHub. Cloning can be done between local repositories or from GitHub to local. Branches are found in any repositories.
